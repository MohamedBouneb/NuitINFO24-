Hi Git community,
-I'm happy to share the experience of "Nuit de l'Info" with the Purovsky Team.

ðŸ’¡ The idea was to build an interactive CAPTCHA for a company with a " globle warming, pollution ..." theme
- We used a JavaScript for coding
- We used PS for create the map and caracteres

  Here The link to test it :)
